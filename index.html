				<h1 class="page-title">Beliefs</h1>
				<p class="intro">There are two guiding principles that drive our ministries and efforts: the Great Commandment and the Great Commission.</p>
				<h2>The Great Commandment</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup>30</sup>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup>31</sup>The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.‚Äù</p>
					<cite>Mark 12:29-31</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<h2>The Great Commission</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup>20</sup>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.</p>
					<cite>Matthew 28:19-20</cite>
				</blockquote>
				<p>We believe that one of the most important ways to obey the Great Commandment (to Love God and Love people) is by obeying the Great Commission and spreading the truth about salvation. If you have any questions about our beliefs, take a look at our Statement of Faith or feel free to contact us directly at any time to ask questions.</p>

				<h2>Four Pillars</h2>
				<p class="attn">While there are many facets to our growing church, we work to orient our ministries around these four foundational pillars. The pillars stem from our principles and keep our efforts focused and biblical.</p>
				<h3>Christ-Centered</h3>
				<p>We strive to keep Christ at the center of everything we do. We see that our love for Him is evidenced by how we love others.</p>
				<h3>Gospel-Focused</h3>
				<p>Walnut Creek Church wants all people to have a transformative, rich relationship with God.</p>
				<h3>Service-Minded</h3>
				<p>We desire to be a blessing to the greater Des Moines community and beyond. We work to serve individuals and organizations with thousands of volunteer hours and support.</p>
				<h3>A Family</h3>
				<p>We want to make disciples because Jesus said so. We work to duplicate our lives and see others raised up to even greater maturity and labor.</p>
